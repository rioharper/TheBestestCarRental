# Sign Up Database Integration - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Added User Creation Function (`database.ts`)
Added a new `createUser()` function that:
- Checks if a user with the email already exists
- Inserts new user into the database
- Returns the newly created user object
- Throws an error if email is already taken

```typescript
export function createUser(email: string, password: string, name: string): User | null
```

### 2. Updated SignUpScreen Component (`SignUpScreen.tsx`)
- **Database Initialization**: The component now initializes the SQL.js database on mount
- **Duplicate Email Check**: Validates that the email isn't already registered
- **Real User Creation**: New accounts are saved to the database
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for:
  - Email already exists
  - Database not ready
  - Account creation failures

## How It Works

1. When the SignUpScreen component loads, it automatically initializes the database
2. When a user submits the sign-up form:
   - All validation checks are performed (password length, matching passwords, etc.)
   - The system checks if an account with that email already exists
   - If email is unique, a new user record is inserted into the `users` table
   - The user is automatically logged in after successful registration
3. If the email already exists, an error message is displayed: "An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead."

## Complete User Flow

### Sign Up → Login Flow:
1. User creates account on SignUpScreen
2. Account is saved to database with email, password, and full name
3. User can now log in using LoginScreen with their new credentials

### Database Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test New Account Creation:
1. Start your development server
2. Navigate to the sign-up screen
3. Fill in the form with:
   - First Name: John
   - Last Name: Doe
   - Email: john@example.com
   - Password: password123 (min 8 characters)
   - Confirm Password: password123
   - Driver's License: 123456789
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You should be logged in automatically

### Test Duplicate Email Prevention:
1. Try to create another account with the same email (john@example.com)
2. You should see an error: "An account with this email already exists. Please sign in instead."

### Test Login with New Account:
1. Log out (if needed)
2. Go to the login screen
3. Log in with your newly created credentials:
   - Email: john@example.com
   - Password: password123
4. Login should succeed!

## Key Features

✅ **Unique Email Validation**: Prevents duplicate accounts
✅ **Password Validation**: Enforces 8+ character passwords
✅ **Password Confirmation**: Ensures passwords match
✅ **Database Persistence**: All new users are saved to the database
✅ **Immediate Login**: Users can log in right after creating an account
✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Users get helpful feedback

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This implementation stores passwords in plain text, which is NOT secure for production use. For a production application, you should:
- Hash passwords using bcrypt, argon2, or similar
- Add email verification
- Implement CAPTCHA to prevent bot registrations
- Add rate limiting
- Use HTTPS
- Store additional user metadata securely
- Implement proper session management
- Add password strength requirements
- Add "forgot password" functionality

## What's Connected Now

✅ **Login Screen**: Authenticates against database
✅ **Sign Up Screen**: Creates new users in database
✅ **User Management**: Complete signup → login flow working

## Next Steps

You could enhance this by:
1. Adding password hashing (bcrypt)
2. Storing the driver's license number in the database
3. Adding email verification
4. Adding password reset functionality
5. Adding user profile management
6. Adding session tokens/JWT authentication
