# Login Database Integration - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Authentication Function (`database.ts`)
Added a new `authenticateUser()` function that validates user credentials against the database:
```typescript
export function authenticateUser(email: string, password: string): User | null
```

### 2. Updated LoginScreen Component (`LoginScreen.tsx`)
- **Database Initialization**: The component now initializes the SQL.js database on mount
- **Real Authentication**: Login now validates credentials against the database instead of accepting any email/password
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for:
  - Invalid credentials
  - Database not ready
  - Missing fields

## How It Works

1. When the LoginScreen component loads, it automatically initializes the database
2. When a user tries to log in, the system:
   - Checks if the database is ready
   - Validates the email and password against the `users` table
   - Only allows login if the credentials match an existing user
3. If credentials are invalid, an error message is displayed: "Invalid email or password. Please try again."

## Test Credentials

The database comes pre-populated with a demo user:
- **Email**: `demo@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Name**: Demo User

## Testing Instructions

1. Start your development server
2. Navigate to the login screen
3. Try logging in with incorrect credentials - you should see an error
4. Try logging in with the demo credentials above - login should succeed
5. Try logging in with any other email/password - you should see "Invalid email or password"

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This implementation stores passwords in plain text, which is NOT secure for production use. For a production application, you should:
- Hash passwords using bcrypt or similar
- Use proper authentication tokens (JWT)
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Next Steps

To add more users to the database, you can:
1. Create a registration function that inserts new users into the database
2. Use the existing `SignUpScreen` component to register new accounts
3. Connect the SignUpScreen to actually save user data to the database
